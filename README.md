# Parallel Video Processing
Parallel Programming (Fall 2015) Final Project

## Abstract
Video processing typically requires immense amounts of computational resources. Devices supporting up to 4K resolution are currently hitting the market by storm. A greater demand for computation has thus arisen. Therefore, we set out to explore ways to boost the efficiency of video processing through a series of experiments. These experiments were conducted with a wide assortment of tools(or APIs) on multiple platforms. We've managed to achieve what we consider maximum possible speedups on our test platforms.

### Endnotes
We would like to thank Prof. Yi-Ping You, Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University and the teaching assistants for an excellent course (Parallel Programming, Fall 2015). The knowledge we gained throughout the course helped us tremendously.

We would also like to thank Prof. Chun-Jen Tsai, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University for lending the FPGA board (ML506 Evaluation Platform) to us and for all the advices he offered during the research.
